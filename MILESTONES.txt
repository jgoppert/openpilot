This is the Milestones file of the OpenPilot project, its intent is to record the major accomplishments achieved by people using the OpenPilot platform and who gets the karma for performing them.  


The CREDITS.txt in SVN records the developers and the achievements made by each individual; this file is different as it is aimed at recording and giving credit to the people who achieve milestones in the use of OpenPilot.

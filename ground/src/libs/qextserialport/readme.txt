Location of qextserialport project is here:

http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/



However there is an alternative in qserialdevice:

http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/QSerialDevice?content=112039

This appears better but much newer.


Hence why this directory is empty, we need to chose which lib to use.

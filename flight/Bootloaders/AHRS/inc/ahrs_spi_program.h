/**Proposed programming protocol:
In the master:
1) Send a AhrsProgramPacket containing the relevant data.
Note crc is a CRC32 as the CRC8 used in hardware can be fooled.
2) Keep sending PROGRAM_NULL packets and wait for an ack.
   Time out if we waited too long.
3) Compare ack packet with transmitted packet. The data
   should be the bitwise inverse of the data transmitted.
   packetId should correspond to the transmitted packet.
4) repeat for next packet until finished
5) Repeat using verify packets
   Returned data should be exactly as read from memory

In the slave:
1) Wait for an AhrsProgramPacket
2) Check CRC then write to memory
3) Bitwise invert data and add it to the return packet
4) Copy packetId from received packet
5) Transmit packet.
6) repeat until we receive a read packet
7) read memory as requested until we receive a reboot packet
Reboot packets had better have some sort of magic number in the data,
just to be absolutely sure

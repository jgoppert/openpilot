OpenPilot - List of tasks to complete
Most to least important


- Main
	Start the FreeRTOS tasks and figure out how it all hangs together. PiOS.c should 
	be got to 3/4 way there asap. More for my understanding than anything.

- Modules
	PIOS_PWM 

there is a trick in the PPZ code in thre stm32 branch to limit the risk of EMI issues. 

Also 

http://www.midibox.org/mios32/manual/group___m_i_o_s32___a_i_n.html

has a special timer for such cases.
 
	PIOS_I2C
	PIOS_ALT
	PIOS_PPM
	PIOS_SPI

- USB Composite Device
	HID and Mass Storage Device
	Needs to be interrupt triggered
	Will disable everything else except USB, no flying while plugged in

- Bootloader FW
	DFU, IAP, or both.

- FreeRTOS, Realtime stats
	Very expensive :-( Only for debug mode


- Web
	Wikipedia entry for the project - before revealing to the world.
	Doc on the Wiki as we write code, more for my understanding and for new Devs.

- Wiki
	Mention the architeture PiOS / OPenPilot connection.

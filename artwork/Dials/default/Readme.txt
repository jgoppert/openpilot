All dials artwork (c) 2010 Edouard Lafargue, Licence CC-BY-SA.

Those dials are the same as in the "share" directory of the GCS, except for one thing: the text elements are still of type 'Text' and have not been converted to Paths, so that they can be modified/updated at a later stage.

Converting to path means that rendering is the same on every target platform, but at the expense of not being able to edit the text.
